                               CHAPTER - 4

                   MANAGING INPUT OUTPUT OPERATIONS
 
Input / Output sattemens
Two types of io statements
-> formatted io statements - user to specify the type of data and the way in which should be read in or written out.
   ex: scanf(), printf()
->unformatted io statements - it will all act on characters
ex: getchar(),gets(),putchar(),puts(),etc

scanf() :
syntax:
scanf("control string", address_list);
address list provides the address of memory locations where the values of input variable should be stored.

character group                  meaning
%u                                read an unsigned value
%d
%f
%c

& - address where we need to store
Integer input:
num=12345
scanf("%3d",&num);    ### only 3 digits can scanned remain digits in buffer #####

printf format:
n=567899033
printf("%05d",n);
### 0 is used to fill the remaining bits ###
In printf we are deferencing the address

----> gcc p1.c   | for compiling the code
----> ./a.out     |

fflush is used to free the temporary buffers
fflush is not work in linux environment

single charcter can scanned by using ascii value

but for float we use scan function like scanf(" "), then it checks the scanf("enter") with the temporary buffer
then it gives the temporary buffer value

###########assignment - how can we avoid with nujeric constants ##########
Scan employee records with folloeing
id, name,gender,address,ph no, salary, designation

print the below format
SlNo | ID  |  NAME | GENDER | ADDRESS | PHNO | SALARY | DESIG

printf("\n%-4s\t|

space or new line character (enter) acts as end of string or character


Error when the string name and its buffer in temp
stack size exceeded

Sol:  To clear the unreserved space we didn't have permission for executable one.

Address of the variables

Address of i: 1440203472
Address of f: 1440203476
Address of ch: 1440203471
Address of str: 1440203488
Address of d: 1440203480

These are the base address of the variable or where the address is stored at initial

we don't give spaces in scanf format specifiers

--> Convert integer to string by using buffer value ( sprintf buff )
---> we can convert string to integer by using (atoi)

/*
unformatted i/o
getc,putc => read/write single char ->stream

getchar,putchar => read/write single char -> std i/o

gets,puts => read/write for a string -> stream

getch() => DOS platform => not echo read char to the screen

*/

/* getc, fgetc */
 getc --> file stream
  fgetc --> file stream

                                          DECISION MAKING AND BRANCHING

Branching is used to check different conditions

if (cond)
{
     if block statements
}

If only one statement we don't need to use { }
** boolean is not a datatype in c**



#include <stdio.h>
   int main()
  
   {
  
      int age;
      scanf("%d",&age);
  
      if (age >= 18)
     {
       printf("\nEligible to vote");
     }
     else
     {
       printf("\nyou are not eligible to vote");
     }
 
     printf("\nI'm an indian citizen\n");
     return 0;


Nested if -else:

basic if -else:

if(cond1)              
{
   if(cond2)
   {
  
   }
   else
   {
 
   }
}  
else
{
   if (cond3) 
   {

   }
   else
   {

   }

}

---> Using the nested if-else statement check the greatest among five numbers <---
