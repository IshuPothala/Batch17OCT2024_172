the stack will grows from bottom to top.

 when bottom equals to top then stack is empty.

when top reaches to limit then stack is full.

container of stack will size fixed/max fix, and we need to declare the bottom.

Inserting of a element 
condition: wheather the stack is full or not.
Deleting an element - remove/pop/pull
condition: stack is empty or not.
pop out one by one and then only bottom will be removed.

how to avoid multiple definitions of variables in multiple files

pragma once

global variables can declared in header files but it is giving error like above.


int *arr = NULL , *temp=NULL;

arr = (int *)malloc(MAX*sizeof(int));

temp=NULL;
