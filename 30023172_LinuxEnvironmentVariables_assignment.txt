1.State the command for the following.

    a. view current environment variables

    b. display the PATH evirnment variable value

    c. update PATH to include the path to your home directory

2. How will you make the environment changes applicable to all users? Which script is to be modified?

3. I have installed an application named “myapp”. After installation, if I invoke the application, it fails with error as “Command myapp not found”. How will you fix this?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
 
1.a) env

1.b) echo $PATH

1.c) export PATH="$PATH:$HOME"   //Including path to home directory

[ before updating the path- /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
  
 After updating the path to home directory - /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/home2/user57 ]


2. To make the environment changes applicable to all users, we need to modify the global environment configuration files.
   
   ex: /etc/profile
     It is used for all the users when they logged in.

3. This issue may occur because of application location is not set to the path variable.
   
   To fix this:
     ->Identify the installation path of "myapp"
     ->Add the application path to the PATH environment variable.
     -> To make this change permanently or globally we can use /etc/profile
