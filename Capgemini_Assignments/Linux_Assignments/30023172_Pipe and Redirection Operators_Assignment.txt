1. Create a script named “myscript” in current directory to do the following.

b) create a file named “dircontent” with contents of the current directory

c) display the contents of the file “dircontent”

d) display the contents of a non existing file named “unknownfile”

2. Run the script and validate the output in following cases

a) Redirect only the stdout to an o/p file named stdout.txt

b) Redirect only the stderr to an o/p file named stderr.txt

c) Redirect both stdout and stderr to an o/p file named stdall.txt

d) Display all o/p and error and also redirect both stdout and stderr to an o/p file named stdall.txt


3. Redirect the output of command below using pipe (|) to wc and get the output .

1.  creating a script named as myscript
       ex: myscript

1.a) mkdir subd1
1.b) ls > dircontent
1.c) cat dircontent
1.d) cat unknownfile

2.a) ./myscript > stdout.txt 2
2.b)./myscript 2> stderr.txt
2.c)./myscript > stdall.txt > stdout.txt > stderr.txt
2.d)./myscript | tee stdall.txt

--> Here tee used for taking the output from command and writes it to both screen and a file.

3) ls -l | wc

ls-l is used  for listing details of files and directories
wc is used for count the lines, words, characters
