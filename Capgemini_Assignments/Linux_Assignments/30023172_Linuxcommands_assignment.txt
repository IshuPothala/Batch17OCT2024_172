1.	Which command is used to know the current working directory?

To know the current working directory we can use  pwd command.
  
2.	How would you find out its contents?

By using  ls  or ll command.

         3. Identify the commands with inputs to do the following
a. create a directory d1
b. create a subdirectory d2 in d1
c. change to directory d2
d. create an empty file “f1.txt”
e. display the contents of “f1.txt”
f. view the contents of d1 from current directory d2
Ans:    $ mkdir d1
$ cd d1
/d1$ mkdir d2
/d1$ cd d2
/d1/d2$ touch f1.txt
/d1/d2$ cat > f1.txt
Hello everyone
Welcome to linux fundamentals
/d1/d2$ cat f1.txt
Hello everyone
Welcome to linux fundamentals
/d1/d2$ ls ..
d2

4. Use the ls command with its options. How will you identify directories from the listing?
       ls -l       [ All detailed information about each item in directory ]
       ls -d */    [ Only directories can be displayed with a trailing  / ]
5. Use ls to do the following
a. List files with single character names.
b. List hidden files also. [ Note : Hidden files are files having name started with a “.” ]
c. Suppose there are files tb1.1, tb2.1, tb3.1, ….tb10.1. Write command to list all the files [Hint: use wild card characters]
Ans:  a)  ls[a-zA-Z]
            b) ls -a
            c)  ls tb?.1

6. Write the command to list all files in descending order of their size.
Ans: ls -lS  ( ls is for list and -l is for long listing , S for sort)

7. Suppose there are files temp1, temp2, temp3. Write command to remove the files without listing them explicitly
Ans:  rm temp*

8. Which command is used to list top few lines in the file?
Ans:  head command is used to list top few lines in the file.
                Ex: $ head <filename>
9. Create a directory “testdir”
Ans: mkdir testdir

10. Use cp command to do the following
a. Copy the file tb1.1 (created above) in the same directory.
b. Write a command to copy all the files i.e tb1.1,tb2.1,tb3.1,…..tb10.1 in a new directory –“new”
c. Create a subdirectory in new in named“new1”.
d. Write a command to copy selectively only tb2.1, tb6.1, tb7.1 and tb10.1 in the directory new1.
e. Write a command to copy the entire directory “new” to a directory “newprogs”. [Note : use the –R option of “cp” command ]
Ans:  a) cp tb1.1 testdir
            b) mkdir new
   cp tb1.1 new
  ~/testdir/new$ touch tb2.1 tb3.1 tb4.1 tb5.1 tb6.1 tb7.1 tb8.1tb9.1 tb10.1
  c) mkdir new1
  d)  cp tb2.1 tb6.1 tb7.1 tb10.1 new1
  e)  cd ../../
      cp -r new newprogs

11. Find out the difference between
a. ]“mv” & “cp”
b. “rm”, “rmdir”
c. “mkdir” and “mkdir -p”
Ans:  a) mv – move the file from one directory to another.
                cp - Used for copy files and directories
          b)  rm – Used to remove both files and directories when they are empty.
                Rmdir – Used to remove only directories when they are empty.
         c) mkdir – Used for make directories
              ex: mkdir d1  
             mkdir -p  - Used for making parent directories / nested directories
              ex: mkdir -p d1 d2 d3
12. Use a single command rmdir once to remove “testdir” and all its sub directories and files created above.
 Ans: rm -r testdir
13. Which command is used to get the manual information of a command?
Ans:  man 
      Ex: man rm
14. If you are not able to change to a directory what could be the likely cause?
Ans: Permission issues
           Path issues
15. Explain the differences among the following commands: 
a. cd /
b. cd ..
c. cd
d. cd ../..
Ans:  a ) current directory changes to the root directory.
           b)   This command moves up to the parent directory of the current directory.
           c)  Change to the home directory of the current directory.
           d) Moving upto two levels in the directory structure.
